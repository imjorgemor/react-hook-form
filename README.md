# use-form-hook

Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

`disclaimer: This is an educational exercise to understand the logic and decisions behind react-hook-form library (and is higly based on their source code structure). This is not intended to be a form management library nor an npm package. For such purpose I highly recommend to use react-hook-form library. To this regard, some state management decisions are highly opinionated in this repo due to personal requirements of the projects I may use this hook.`

`The one and only use case of this hook is for such projects that due to security limitations external dependencies (a part from react) are prohibited, in such case I recommend to copy the source files (useForm, types and createFormControl) and make the amendments you may consider according your form management decisions. I believe is easier to dig in less than 1000 lines of code of 3 files than fork or download all the react-hook-form repository and understand all the logic and abstractions they have implemented.`
