# use-form-hook

Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

`disclaimer: This is an educational exercise to understand the logic and decisions behind react-hook-form library (and is higly based on their source code structure). This is not intended to be a form management library nor an npm package. For such purpose I highly recommend to use react-hook-form library. To this regard, some state management decisions are highly opinionated in this repo due to personal requirements of the projects I may use this hook.`

`The one and only use case of this hook is for such projects that due to security limitations external dependencies (a part from react) are prohibited, in such case I recommend to copy the source files (useForm, types and createFormControl) and make the amendments you may consider according your form management decisions. Please note this code only supports simple forms without embeded objects nor arrays. If you happen to be in this corner situation it could be  easier to dig in less than 1000 lines of code of 3 files than fork or download all the react-hook-form repository and understand all the logic and abstractions they have implemented.`

## Generic Props

- `defaultValues`: Default values for the form.
- `mode`: Validation strategy before submitting behaviour.
- `resolver`: Integrates a custom schema validation rules.
- `disabled`: Disable the entire form with all associated inputs.
- `errors`: Reactive errors to update the form errors.

### mode 
This option allows you to configure the validation strategy before a user submits the form. The validation occurs during the onSubmit event, which is triggered by invoking the handleSubmit function.
- `onSubmit`: Validation is triggered on the submit event, and inputs attach onChange event listeners to re-validate themselves.
- `onChange`: Validation is triggered on the changeevent for each input, leading to multiple re-renders. Warning: this often comes with a significant impact on performance.
- `all`: Validation is triggered on submit and change events.

### defaultValues
The defaultValues prop populates the entire form with default values. It is highly recommended to use defaultValues for the entire form and fields shall be initialized as their type (string, number, boolean...).

### errors
The errors props will react to changes and update the server errors state, which is useful when your form needs to be updated by external server returned errors. It is also useful to initialize the form with errors.

### disabled
This config allows you to disable the entire form and all associated inputs when set to true.
This can be useful for preventing user interaction during asynchronous tasks or other situations where inputs should be temporarily unresponsive.

### resolver
This prop allows you to pass a validation rule and it is executed asynchronously.


## register (name: string, options?: RegisterOptions) => ({ ref, name, onChange, onBlur })
This method allows you to register an input or select element and apply validation rules to React Hook Form. Validation rules are all based on the HTML standard and also allow for custom validation methods.

### props
- `name`: Input's name (string)
- `options`: Input's behavior (register options like min, max, disabled)

### example
```tsx
import { useFormHook } from "./hooks/useFormHook"

export default function App() {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
      category: "",
      checkbox: false,
      radio: "",
    },
  })

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(console.log)}>
      <input
        {...register("firstName", { required: true })}
        placeholder="First name"
      />

      <input
        {...register("lastName", { minLength: 2 })}
        placeholder="Last name"
      />

      <select {...register("category")}>
        <option value="">Select...</option>
        <option value="A">Category A</option>
        <option value="B">Category B</option>
      </select>

      <input {...register("checkbox")} type="checkbox" value="A" />

      <input {...register("radio")} type="radio" value="A" />
      <input {...register("radio")} type="radio" value="B" />
      <input {...register("radio")} type="radio" value="C" />

      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  )
}
```
